This is android apps data containing more than 10k google play applications from 2010 till 2018 worldwide.

This data contains 10839 rows and 11 columns with fields like app id, name, ratings, price describing the information about each google play applications being used globally.

I have used Tableu as the front room for the application for Data visualization.
